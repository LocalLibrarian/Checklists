# Checklists Android App
## Description
This is a personal project I made that allows the user to create lists with tasks that can be named whatever the user wishes, moved between other lists, and have a user-defined amount of clicks before they are marked as complete.
Lists themselves can also be moved and organized using a virtual file system. There are of course other features as well and a comprehensive settings menu.
## Requirements
Probably a JVM and Android Studio as the app is written fully in Kotlin.
## How to Use
Build the app in Android Studio or something similar. Deploy it on a physical device or emulator. There will be a tutorial on how to use the app that will appear on first-time use.
## Future Improvements
- Add custom image use for item icons
- Possibly some sort of sharing feature
- More animations
- General performance improvements
